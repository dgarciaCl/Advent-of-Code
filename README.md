Here are my solutions to the **Advent of Code** programming challenges.

## Languages used

I’ve tried to make use of all the programming languages I know:

- **Odd days:** `Python`
- **Even days:** `C++`

## Credits

All puzzle ideas and problem descriptions belong to **Advent of Code** and **Eric Wastl**.
